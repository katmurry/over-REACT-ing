# over-REACT-ing

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.... and I want in on it.

## Purpose of this Repo
* **Practice, Practice, Practice:** This is the environment where I can keep track of micro-training projects that I have built using React.
* **The Future?:** Who knows, I may use this repository to end up containing ALL my REACT based projects, including large ones! For now, that is up in the air. I want to keep this repository simple.
